# First boot, ID and specs

After device arrived, I've removed a battery and checked the inner label:

Inner label shows model number PU10, "HTC Innovation" ("Innovation" is not the model name,
it's like "Nokia Connecting People") and IMEI with TAC 35519500, belonging to HTC,
corresponding to MDA pro,Dopod 900,Universal,XDA Exec models. Battery model is PU16A.

On the inner cover there is a hologram label with "Bitė" telco operator name (MCC + MNC: 246 02),
saying "Qtek bitė edition", which could potentially mean phone can be operator-locked.

And if you wonder - stylus is inside:

Battery was not completely dead and showed ~1V checked by the tester, and charging.
After less than half an hour of charging, it did try to boot, showing a boot screen:
